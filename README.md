## Authentication
_Currently, only `basic_auth` is supported and nothing has been tested with except on 
Atlassian Cloud Products._

Atlassisaurus assumes that you have two env vars set for authentication:
`ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` and `ATLASSIAN_TOKEN`. `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` is the email you use
to authenticate to Atlassian Cloud. `ATLASSIAN_TOKEN` contains an API Token that
you have generated within Atlassian Cloud (look [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)
for assistance creating an API Token for your Atlassian account).

## Why the name?
Because its kind of cute? I mean, we call ourselves rustaceans. Just don't get crabby with me, OK?! ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
